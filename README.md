# nuclei_segmentation_using_mrcnn
This repository is a sample project that delivers Google Colab code to perform segmentation for cell nucleus in biomedical imaged.

## Requirements
(Some downgrading are required if you are using the latest versions)
- Tensoflow==1.x
- Keras==2.x
- Scikit-image==0.16.x

## Steps to implement
### 1: Clone the libraries at https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN
- Copy the mrcnn directory to your google drive working directory
- Data will be automatically downloaded while running the code

### 2: Clone the nucleus_segmentation.ipynb to perform segmentation

## Happy Segmenting!!!
